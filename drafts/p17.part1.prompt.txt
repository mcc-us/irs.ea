Place the output, your response, or the answer in a "copy-code" box. I want the output transcribed into markdown language. I want to place your answer in a website. I want to save the output into a .md file.

Using the PDF document "p17.part1.pdf", provide a more comprehensive outline than the previous one. I need more detail than the previous outline. I want details such as information from tables or bullet points. 

I want you to specifically address the numbered points below. 
This chapter discusses the following topics:
1. Whether you have to file a return.
2. How to file electronically.
3. How to file for free.
4. When, how, and where to file your return.
5. What happens if you pay too little or too much tax.
6. What records you should keep and how long you should keep them.
7. How you can change a return you have already filed.

I want to know what form numbers are referenced for each Line. For example, In the document it states,
"New lines on Schedule 3. This year Schedule
3 has new lines.
• Line 5a will be used to report the residen-
tial clean energy credit from Form 5695.
• Line 5b will be used to report the energy
efficient home improvement credit from
Form 5695.
• Line 6m will be used to report the credit for
previously owned clean vehicles from Form
8936.
• Line 13c will be used to report the elective
payment election amount from Form 3800."


Using each bold header subpart and section give a sentence or two that describes the content in that bold part. Make sure that important peices of information are collected and included in the outline.

After Part One is complete, please produce 5 quiz-like questions on the reading material directly in that chapter. Please follow this example:
1. Produce a 1-2 sentence summary of the entire Part one. 
2. Include the label of each Sub-Part then include its outline
3. Provide 3 quiz-like questions, and their answers from each of the sub-parts
4. Continue to next sub-part.
