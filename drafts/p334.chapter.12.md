# Chapter 12: Business Use of Your Home

## Introduction
- Provides detailed guidance on how to determine and calculate the deduction for the business use of your home, commonly known as the home office deduction.

## Qualifying for a Deduction
1. **Exclusive Use Requirement:**
   - Part of your home must be used exclusively and regularly for conducting business to qualify for the deduction.
2. **Principal Place of Business:**
   - Your home must be the principal place of business, or a place where you regularly meet clients or customers.
3. **Separate Structure:**
   - The deduction may also apply to a separate structure not attached to your home, such as a studio, garage, or barn, used exclusively and regularly for business.

## Types of Deductible Expenses
1. **Direct Expenses:**
   - Expenses only for the business part of your home, such as painting or repairs in the area used for business, which are fully deductible.
2. **Indirect Expenses:**
   - Expenses for keeping up and running your entire home, such as insurance, utilities, and general repairs, which are deductible based on the percentage of your home used for business.
3. **Unrelated Expenses:**
   - Expenses for parts of your home not used for business, such as lawn care or painting a room not used for business, are not deductible.

## Calculating the Deduction
1. **Simplified Option:**
   - Deduct $5 per square foot of home used for business, up to a maximum of 300 square feet, for a maximum deduction of $1,500.
2. **Regular Method:**
   - Calculate the percentage of your home used for business by dividing the area used for business by the total area of your home.
   - Apply this percentage to indirect expenses to determine the deductible amount.
3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Provides a step-by-step example of how to calculate the home office deduction using both the simplified and regular methods.

## Limits on the Deduction
1. **Gross Income Limitation:**
   - The total deduction for the business use of your home cannot exceed the gross income from your business, minus business expenses other than the home office deduction.
2. **Carryover of Unused Deduction:**
   - If your home office deduction is limited by your gross income, you can carry over the unused deduction to the next year.

## Deduction for Employees
1. **Eligibility:** 
   - The home office deduction is generally not available for employees unless the use of the home office is for the convenience of the employer and is required as a condition of employment.
2. **Employee Business Expenses:**
   - Deductible employee expenses are limited and subject to the 2% of adjusted gross income (AGI) floor.

## Recordkeeping Requirements
1. **Importance of Records:**
   - Keep accurate records of all expenses related to the business use of your home, including receipts, canceled checks, and other documents that support your deduction.
2. **Examples of Records:**
