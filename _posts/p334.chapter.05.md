# Chapter 5: Net Operating Losses (NOLs)

- Explains Net Operating Loss (NOL), how it is calculated, and how it can be used to reduce taxable income in other years.

## What is a Net Operating Loss?

1. Definition: Occurs when a business's allowable tax deductions exceed its gross income.
2. Sources of NOL: Can arise from operating losses, casualty and theft losses, and certain other deductions.
3. Non-Deductible Items: Capital losses, personal exemptions, and nonbusiness deductions are generally not included in calculating an NOL.

## Carrybacks and Carryforwards

1. Carryforward: An NOL can be carried forward to future tax years to offset income.
2. Carryback: Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), NOLs could be carried back to prior years to claim a refund. Post-TCJA, carrybacks are generally not allowed.
3. Election to Waive Carryback: Taxpayers may elect to waive the carryback period and only carry the NOL forward.

## Figuring an NOL

1. Calculating NOL:  
   - Start with taxable income before exemptions.
   - Subtract nonbusiness income and add nonbusiness deductions.
   - Adjust for NOL deductions from prior years.
2. Adjustments to Income: Certain adjustments, like nonbusiness deductions, may need to be made to the income to figure the NOL.

## How to Claim an NOL Deduction

1. Filing Form: Use Schedule A of Form 1045 or Form 1040 to claim an NOL deduction.
2. NOL Carryforward: Report the NOL carryforward on Form 1040, Schedule 1, in the year it is applied.

## Example of an NOL

1. Illustrative Example: Provides a detailed example of how an NOL is calculated, including adjustments and the steps to carry it forward or back.
2. NOL Deduction in Future Years: Explains how the NOL deduction reduces income in subsequent years.
