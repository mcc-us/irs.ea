Enrolled
agents generally have unlimited practice rights,
meaning they can represent any taxpayer
regarding any tax matter before any IRS office.
**Free Resources**

Finding a comprehensive, free guide specifically for the Enrolled Agent (EA) exam is challenging, as most detailed and structured study materials are paid. However, the IRS has resources that can help you prepare.
