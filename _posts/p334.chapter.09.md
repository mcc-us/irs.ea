2. Original Basis:
   - Purchased Property: Generally, the cost of the property plus any amounts paid for improvements & expenses related to the purchase.
   - Inherited Property: Generally, the fair market value (FMV) of the property on the date of the decedent's death.
   - Gifted Property: Generally, the donor's adjusted basis at the time of the gift, with some adjustments.
3. Adjusted Basis:
   - Increases to Basis: Include the cost of improvements, legal fees, & certain assessments.
   - Decreases to Basis: Include depreciation, casualty & theft losses, & certain credits & deductions.

## Cost Basis

1. Cost Basis of Purchased Property:
   - Includes: Purchase price, sales tax, freight, installation, & other costs associated with acquiring the property.
   - Excludes: Financing costs such as interest on loans.
2. Special Rules:
   - Real Property: Costs of buildings & land should be allocated separately.
   - Business Start-Up Costs: Certain start-up costs can be added to the basis of the property.

## Basis Other than Cost

1. Inherited Property:
   - General Rule: The basis is the fair market value (FMV) on the date of the decedent's death.
   - Alternative Valuation Date: If elected, the FMV on the alternate valuation date can be used.
2. Gifted Property:
   - General Rule: The basis is the donor's adjusted basis at the time of the gift, unless the FMV is less than the donor's adjusted basis.
   - Special Rule for Losses: If the FMV is less than the donor's adjusted basis, the basis for determining loss is the FMV.
3. Property Received in Exchange:
   - Like-Kind Exchanges: The basis of the new property is generally the same as the basis of the property exchanged, with adjustments for any additional money paid or received.

## Adjusted Basis

1. Increases to Basis:
   - Improvements: Costs of improvements that add to the value of the property or extend its life.
   - Assessments: Government assessments for local improvements.
   - Restoration Costs: Costs to restore property after a casualty loss.
2. Decreases to Basis:
   - Depreciation: Deduction for wear & tear, deterioration, or obsolescence.
   - Casualty & Theft Losses: Losses deducted from the basis after an event that damages or destroys the property.
   - Exclusions, Credits, & Rebates: Various tax benefits that reduce the basis.

## Basis of Certain Assets

1. Real Property:
   - Land & Buildings: Basis must be allocated between the land & the buildings; land cannot be depreciated.
   - Easements: The sale of an easement reduces the basis of the affected property.
2. Business Assets:
   - Inventory: The basis is generally the cost of the inventory items.
   - Depreciable Property: The basis is the cost minus any depreciation claimed.
3. Intangible Assets:
   - Goodwill: If acquired as part of a business purchase, the basis is the purchase price allocated to goodwill.
   - Patents & Copyrights: The basis is generally the cost to create or purchase the patent or copyright.

## Basis in Special Situations

1. Property Changed from Personal to Business Use:
   - The basis is the lesser of the FMV at the time of conversion or the adjusted basis of the property.
2. Partnership Interests:
   - The basis is the amount of money contributed to the partnership, plus the partner's share of partnership liabilities.
3. S Corporation Stock:
   - The basis is the original cost of the stock, adjusted for items such as income, losses, & distributions.
