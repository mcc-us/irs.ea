Accounting Periods

Most people use a calendar year for their tax returns, covering January 1 to December 31. If you don't, you're using a fiscal year, which is any 12-month period ending on the last day of a month other than December. A 52-53 week fiscal year lasts between 52 and 53 weeks and ends on the same day of the week each year. You choose your accounting period (tax year) when you file your first tax return, and it can't be longer than 12 months.
For more details on accounting periods or how to change them, see Publication 538.

Accounting Methods

Your accounting method is how you record income and expenses. Most people use either the cash or accrual method. You choose one when you file your first return, and to change it later, you need IRS approval. Use Form 3115 to request a change.

1. Cash Method: You report income when you actually receive it and deduct expenses when you pay them. Most individuals use this method.
1. Constructive Receipt: You’re considered to have received income if it’s available to you, even if you haven’t physically received it. For example, interest credited to your bank account on December 31 is taxable in that year, even if you withdraw it later.
1. Garnished Wages: If your wages are garnished or used to pay debts, you must include them in your income.
1. Debts Paid for You: If someone cancels or pays your debts (not as a gift or loan), you must include it in your income.
1. Payments to a Third Party or Agent: If someone else is paid from your property or an agent receives income for you, it's considered your income when they receive it.
1. Checks: A check made available to you before the end of the tax year counts as income for that year, whether or not you cash it.

- If there are circumstances where you don’t have access to the income, you might not have "constructively received" it.

- Example: A teacher agrees to only receive the difference between their salary and the cost of a substitute teacher. The amount deducted for the substitute is not considered "constructively received."

- Accrual Method: You report income when you earn it, not when you receive it, and you deduct expenses when you incur them, not when you pay them.

- Advance Payments: Any payments you receive in advance, like rent or interest, are generally included as income in the year you receive them, regardless of your accounting method. However, a limited deferral may apply for certain payments.

- See Publication 538, Accounting Periods and Methods
