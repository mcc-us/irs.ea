**Enrolled agents** generally have unlimited practice rights, meaning they can represent any taxpayer regarding any tax matter before any IRS office.

Finding a comprehensive, free guide specifically for the Enrolled Agent (EA) exam is challenging, as most detailed & structured study materials are paid. However, the IRS has resources that can help you prepare.
