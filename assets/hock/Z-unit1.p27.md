- **Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN)**

ATINs are designed for adopted children who are not yet eligible for an SSN. An ATIN is requested using **Form W-7A**, Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending US Adoptions. For an adopted child who does not have an SSN, a taxpayer may request an ATIN IF:

1. The child is placed in the taxpayer's home for real adoption.  
2. The adoption is a domestic adoption or a foreign legal adoption, and the child has a permanent resident alien card or certificate of citizenship.  
3. The taxpayer cannot obtain the child's existing SSN, even though he has made a reasonable attempt to obtain it from the birth parents, the placement agency, etc.  
4. The taxpayer cannot obtain an SSN, as the adoption still needs to be finalized.  

An ATIN issued for an adoptive child expires two years from the date it is issued, although an extension can be requested using IRS Form 15100, *Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number Extension Request*. 

- An ATIN **cannot** be used to obtain the *Earned Income Tax Credit*, the *Child Tax Credit*, or the *American Opportunity Tax Credit*.

- **Special Rules for a Deceased Child**

- If a child is born and dies within the same tax year and is not granted an SSN, the taxpayer may still claim that child as a dependent.

> Example: On October 9, 2023, Diane had a newborn son. Sadly, he faced health complications and passed away one week later. The child was issued both a birth certificate and a death certificate but no Social Security number.   
> Diane can still claim her son as a qualifying child when filing taxes. She will need to submit a paper return in order to do so. Her son will still be considered a **qualifying child** for tax purposes, even though he only lived for a short time. 

The tax return **must be filed on paper** with 

1. a copy of the birth certificate. The birth certificate must show that the child was born alive; a stillborn infant does not qualify.

2. a hospital medical record attached.  

The taxpayer should enter the word "DIED" in the space for the dependent SSN on the tax return, 

- **Recordkeeping Requirements for Individuals** It is the responsibility of taxpayers, with or without the assistance of a tax preparer, to maintain copies of their tax returns and related records for as long as necessary or the administration of federal tax laws. Typically, taxpayers must retain copies of their tax returns and supporting documentation for at least three years from the date they were filed or the due date, whichever is later.

**There are no specific guidelines**

These include:  

1. identifying sources of income,  
2. keeping track of expenses for deductions,  
3. documenting the cost and improvements made to owned property,   
4. substantiating items reported on tax returns in case of an audit, 
5. aiding in the accurate preparation of future tax returns. 

> In cases of an IRS audit, it is the taxpayer's responsibility to provide proof and documentation for their claimed expenses.  
>  
> Even if a tax professional prepares and signs a tax return, the taxpayer is the one ultimately responsible for the accuracy of his records.
