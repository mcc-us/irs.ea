1. Read the textbook

2. Watch the Videos
 
Note: Not every detail in the books is covered in the videos,

3. Answer the MCQs

Answering practice questions without studying the materials will not prepare you for the exam. The questions on the exam will be very different from the practice questions. Only studying and knowing the concepts will prepare you to answer the unfamiliar questions on the exam.

4. Review / Forum / Ask Questions

If you have questions after going through the materials, ask for help from our teachers in the Student Forum.
