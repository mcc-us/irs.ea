Taxpayer Biographical Information

Information is required when filing tax returns. A tax professional must collect this information: 
1. legal name, 
2. date of birth, 
3. marital status, 
4. Residency status and/or citizenship, 
5. Dependent information, 
5. taxpayer's identification number (SSN, PTIN; GF NTIN)

To prevent fraud, tax preparers may need to request IDs. Photo IDs are preferred and should include the taxpayer's name and current address. Tax preparers must also verify social security cards, ITIN letters, and other docs to ensure that the correct TINS are used for the taxpayer, their spouse, and any dependents listed on the return. 

Additionally, taxpayers can request an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN), which must be entered into software for the IRS to accept an electronically filed tax return. This service is now available to anyone, regardless of whether they have been a victim of identity theft. The IRS requires all individuals listed on a federal income tax return to have a valid Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), including the taxpayer, their spouse (if married), and any dependents listed. 

- **Three types of TINS are:**
1. Social Security number (SSN)
2. Individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN)
3. Adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN)

> **Note**: The personal and financial information is considered Sensitive and confidential. A preparer who wrongfully discloses a taxpayer's information could face civil and criminal charges.

A taxpayer who cannot obtain an SSN must apply for an ITIN to file a US tax return. Generally, only US citizens and lawfully admitted noncitizens authorized to work in the United States are eligible for a Social Security number.

Non-resident aliens with a US tax liability generally have ITINS.

A taxpayer with an ITIN cannot receive Social Security benefits or the **Earned Income Tax Credit**. ITINS are for federal tax reporting only and are not intended to serve any other purpose.

A form is used for ATIN requests, Form **W7A, Application for Taxpayer ID Number for Pending US Adoptions.
