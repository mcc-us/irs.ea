- **Tax Return Due Dates and Extensions**

The expected due date is April 15. If it falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the date is extended until the next business day.

A tax return is considered filed "on time" if the envelope is properly addressed, postmarked, and deposited in the mail by the due date. 

If a tax return is postmarked on April 15 but does not arrive at an IRS service center until April 30, the IRS must accept the tax return, the "mailbox rule." 

E-filed tax returns are given an "electronic postmark" in cases where tax returns are filed close to the deadline; a taxpayer should pay for proof of mailing or certified mail.

> Example: Seraphina is an enrolled agent who specializes in handling tax returns. One of her clients, Watson, is a single father to his 14-year-old daughter, Emily, and provides all financial support for her. On April 15, 2024, Seraphina attempted to file Watson's 2023 tax return electronically, but it was rejected because someone else had already claimed Emily as a dependent. Watson suspects that his estranged ex-wife may have tried to claim their daughter, but he has no way of confirming or contacting her. Upon realizing the issue cannot be resolved electronically, Seraphina advises filing a paper return instead. She prints out the necessary forms for Watson, and he signs them with an original ink signature before they are sent via certified mail before the post office closes. The return is considered timely and undergoes regular processing. Approximately eight weeks later, Watson received his full refund.

- If a taxpayer cannot file by the due date, the taxpayer may request an extension by filing Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File, which may be filed electronically. The extension must be filed by the original due date. An extension grants an additional six months to file a tax return.

> Note: An extension gives a taxpayer extra time to file. It does not extend the time to pay. Taxpayers must estimate and pay taxes by the original deadline.

- **Filing Deadline Exceptions**

- Federal Disaster Areas: Taxpayers in federally declared disaster areas (FEMA Disasters) are granted a postponement to file and pay their taxes and to make estimated payments. The IRS may also abate interest and any late filing or payment penalties that apply to the taxpayer in these disaster areas. 

This type of tax relief generally includes:

1. Individuals and businesses located in a disaster area

2. Those whose tax records are located in a disaster area,

3. Relief workers whore working in the disaster area.

A taxpayer does not have to be physically located in a federally declared disaster area to qualify as an "affected taxpayer." 

Taxpayers are also affected if the records necessary to meet a filing or payment deadline are postponed during the relief period in a covered disaster area. Therefore, disaster relief also applies to tax preparers (and their clients) who are unable to file returns or make payments on behalf of their clients because of a disaster.
