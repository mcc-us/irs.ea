Example: Declan owns a 30% interest in a federally declared disaster area partnership. However, Declan himself does not live in the disaster zone. Since he must rely on the partnership's information (Schedule K-1) to file his tax return, he qualifies as an “affected taxpayer” for receiving filing and payment relief. Declan’s filing and payment deadlines are suspended until the end of the postponement period, just like the affected partnership.

- **June 15 Deadlines (Automatic Two-Month Extension)**

Three groups of taxpayers are granted an automatic two-month extension to file:

1. Nonresident aliens who do not have wage income subject to US withholding,

2. US. Citizens or legal US. residents who are living outside the United States or Puerto Rico, and
their principal place of business is outside the US or Puerto Rico,

3. Taxpayers on active military service duty outside the US.

A citizen or resident alien living abroad must attach a statement to their tax return explaining which situation qualifies for this particular two-month extension. Even if an extension is allowed, the taxpayer will have to pay interest on any tax not paid by the regular tax deadline of April 15.

December 15 filing extension: For most Americans and US residents living abroad, the six-month extension to October 15 is sufficient. However, a taxpayer residing outside the United States can request an additional “discretionary” two-month extension to file their tax return beyond the six-month extension of October 15.

For calendar-year taxpayers, the “additional” extension date would be December 15.1° Unless the extension request is denied, the taxpayer will not receive a response from the IRS.

Example: Isabella is a US. Citizen residing and working in Portugal. She has already requested a 6-month extension for filing her tax return using Form 4868. However, she realizes that she may require more time to ensure the accuracy and completeness of her return, as she is still waiting on essential
financial documents from a Portuguese bank that has paid her interest during the year. Without these documents, Isabella fears that her income tax return will not be accurate. Luckily, as an expatriate living abroad, she can obtain an additional 2-month extension, giving her until December 15 to file her US. Tax return.

Notable Exception for Combat Zones: The deadline for filing a tax return, claiming a refund, and the deadline for payment of tax owed is automatically extended for any service member, Red Cross personnel, accredited correspondent, or contracted civilian serving in a combat zone.

These taxpayers have their tax deadlines suspended from the day they start serving in the combat zone until 180 days after leaving it. The deadline postponement provision applies to estate, gift, employment, and excise tax returns. These deadline extensions also apply to the spouses of armed service members serving in combat zones. The extension applies to both spouses, whether joint or separate returns are filed.

In addition to the standard 6-month extension, taxpayers who are out of the country can request a discretionary 2-month additional extension of time to file their returns (to December 15). See Publication 54 for complete instructions on how to request this extension.
