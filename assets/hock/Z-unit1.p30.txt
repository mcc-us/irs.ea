- **Tax Return Due Daates and Extensions**

The normal due date is April 15. If it falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; the date is extended until the next business day.

A tax return is considered filed "on time" if the envelope is properly addressed, postmarked, and deposited in the mail by the due date. 

If a tax return is postmarked on April 15 but does not arrive at an IRS service center until April 30, the IRS must accept the tax return, the “mailbox rule.” 

E-filed tax returns are given an “electronic postmark” in cases where a tax returns filed close to the deadline, it is highly advisable for a taxpayer to pay for proof of mailing or certified mail.

> Example: Seraphina is an enrolled agent who specializes in handling tax returns. One of her clients, Watson, is a single father to his 14-year-old daughter, Emily, and provides all financial support for her. On April 15, 2024, Seraphina attempts to electronically file Watson's 2023 tax return but it is rejected due to someone else already claiming Emily as a dependent. Watson suspects that his estranged ex-wife may have tried to claim their daughter, but he has no way of confirming or contacting her. Upon realizing the issue cannot be resolved electronically, Seraphina advises filing a paper return instead. She prints out the necessary forms for Watson and he signs them with an original ink signature before they are sent via certified mail before the post office closes. The return is considered timely and undergoes regular processing. Approximately eight weeks later, Watson receives his full refund.

- If a taxpayer cannot file by the due date, the taxpayer may request an extension by filing Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File, which may be filed electronically. The extension must be filed by the original due date. An extension grants an additional six months to file a tax return.

> Note: An extension gives a taxpayer extra time to file. It does not extend the time to pay. Tax payers must estimate and pay taxes by the original deadline.
