1. Income: Forms W-2, Forms 1099, bank statements, pay stubs, brokerage statements, Schedules K-1.

2. Expenses: Sales slips, invoices, receipts, credit card statements, canceled checks or other proof of payments, written communications from qualified charities, Forms 1098 to support mortgage interest, and real estate taxes paid if paid through an impound account).

3. Home purchase and sale: Closing statements, HUD statements, purchase and sales invoices, proof of payment, insurance records, and receipts for improvement costs.

4. Investments: Brokerage statements, mutual fund statements, Forms 1099-DIV. 

- **Basic Tax Forms for Individuals**

- **Form 1040**: Form 1040 is the primary tax form for filing
tax returns. The Form 1040 includes three schedules:  

1. Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income, reports income not listed directly on Form 1040, such as taxable alimony, unemployment compensation, and gambling winnings. Schedule 1 includes adjustments to income, like student loan interest deduction, self-employed health insurance deduction, and the deduction for educator expenses.

2. Schedule 2, Additional Taxes, reports additional taxes such as the alternative minimum, self-employment, or household employment taxes.

3. Schedule 3, Additional Credits and Payments, has two main sections: nonrefundable credits and refundable credits.

**Form 1040-SR** is for use by seniors 65 or older. This form is essentially the same as the standard Form 1040 but is designed to be easier to read with a bigger font.

- **Form 1040-NR** is by nonresident aliens to report their US. source income.

- **Form 1040-NR** uses Schedules 1, 2, and 3, just like Form 1040. The 1040-NR is never used by US citizens or residents. The IRS defines an "alien" as any individual who is not a US citizen or national. A nonresident alien is an alien who has not passed the green card test or the substantial presence test. Form 1040-NR is used by foreign investors and nonresident taxpayers who earn money while in the US.

> Example: Angelo, a Filipino citizen and world-famous boxer, receives permission to enter the US on a special visa in order to participate in a champion boxing match. He earns a substantial income of $900,000 for his appearance but only stays in the US for six days before returning to his home country. Angelo is not eligible for a Social Security Number (SSN), so he must request an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to report his US earnings. Without the ITIN, he would face automatic backup withholding on his income. Thankfully, Angelo's tax accountant requested the ITIN and correctly filed his income taxes using Form 1040-NR, which only required him to report the income he earned while in the United States, not his worldwide income.
