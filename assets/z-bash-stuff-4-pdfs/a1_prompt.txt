Generally: 
I want a bash script that will organize the files in one directory. 

I have a list of PDF files in one directory. 
All files start with "i", "p" or "f". 
All files have the extension, ".pdf".

I would like to use a multi-step approach.

1. Remove the first character of the filename and save the name to a list.
All the files have the extension ".pdf".
2. Using the list, remove the file extensions, ".pdf" from all the files names, saving the resultant.
3. Next I want the list of abbrevaited-filenames sorted in ascending order. 

For example: (p555.pdf, i456.pdf, f1010-sr.pdf) would become (1010, 456, 555)

4. Print the list of filenames to a new text document, called a1_names.txt.
